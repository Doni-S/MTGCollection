![mtg_collection](https://github.com/Doni-S/MTGCollection/assets/72990446/69d7cc85-571d-46e0-adfb-f388d4ff146c)

This is a repository to analyze my MTG Collection.

## Installation

use [ManaBox](https://manabox.app/)  to upload collection there and export as a .csv.
[ManaBox](https://manabox.app/) exports .csv with current market prices.

## Background
I needed a way to track my collection and track the net value from the product purchased.

The other apps and websites I used did not have the option to add in the prices when the product was bought compared to current prices.

I never saw an option to include sealed product, they only offered information for singles. 

## Categorizations
I listed the name of each card along with the set code to distiguish between cards of the same name but different printings since they often times have different prices.

Filters for about every aspect of a card relating to your collections value, so I excluded categories like *Color*, *Flavor Text*, *Card Type*, *Text*, *Abilities*, *Mana Value*, *Power and Toughness* etc.

## Dashboard

There are categorization filters if you need to see something more specific in your collection.

At a glance we can see the number for the **Total** portforlio value, **Least valuble card**, **Most Valuble Card**, **Average Price** and **Total Number** of cards in the collection.

The **Pie Chart** is set to the percentage of different rarities in the collection.

The **Bar Graph** has all the value of each individual card in asceding order (Left=Lowest) (Right=Highest)

The bottom chart is all the information at once to have an overall view in one place.
